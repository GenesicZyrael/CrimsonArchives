# CrimsonArchives
The not so final resting place of cards. There are several reasons why cards can end up here, but mainly they're here to preserve the work I've done. I'm listing whatever reason I may have as well, so that I don't need to remind myself why they ended up here in the first place.

* 01/16/2024 - Zefras: Archived due to rework of custom cards.
* 06/04/2024 - Jurracs: Archived due to rework of custom cards.
* 08/29/2025 - Dragunity: Archived due to rework.
